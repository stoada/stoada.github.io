# iFAST - Intelligent Flood Alert Surveillance Tools (CNPq Grant #446053/2023-6)

## Abstract

The general objective of this project is to produce interdisciplinary scientific knowledge and promote technological development in the generation of forecast products for hydrological extremes in river basins with a history of flash floods and urban flooding.

Specific objectives are: 

* Compose a public database for the study areas, considering in situ sensors (rain gauges and hydrological stations), remote sensing (weather radars), electrical discharge data, and Crowdsourcing (via social networks and news websites);
* Propose a benchmark with different ML techniques on the same data set, including analysis of the importance of each input data (fostering explainability), comparison with persistence models and physical hydrological models, and proposal of hybrid models (using Physics Informed Neural Networks);
* Improve the performance of empirical hydrological models considering different forecast horizons (from 15 min to 6 hours);
* Evaluate the spatiality of forecasts by adding a geographic component of area to the hydrological stations-based forecasts;
* Promote uncertainty analysis in the flow that goes from model input data to forecast results;
* Evaluate the operational applicability of the models, considering data failures and delays, and test how to present the results to decision-makers.
